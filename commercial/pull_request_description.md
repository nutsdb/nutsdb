# Commercialisation Feature Examples and Tests

## Description

This PR adds example and test files to demonstrate how NutsDB could be extended for commercial use. It includes:

- `commercial_test.go`: A test for a hypothetical advanced backup feature, which could be offered as a commercial service.
- `commercial_example.go`: An example of a priority support API, simulating a commercial feature for enterprise customers.
- `pull_request_description.md`: This PR description summarizing the changes.

## Proposed Commercial Features

Based on issue #552 requesting suggestions for commercialization, these files demonstrate two potential commercial offerings:

### 1. Advanced Backup System
- Incremental backups with reduced storage requirements
- Encrypted backups for sensitive data
- Compressed backups to save storage space
- Cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
- Scheduled backups with retention policies

### 2. Enterprise Support and SLAs
- Priority support with guaranteed response times
- Different support tiers (silver, gold, platinum)
- 24/7 support for mission-critical deployments
- Dedicated support engineers for premium customers

### 3. Enterprise Features (mentioned but not fully implemented)
- High availability with replication
- Automatic backups with configurable frequency
- Monitoring and telemetry
- Extended retention and durability options

## Testing

The code includes:
- A test file demonstrating how an advanced backup system might work
- An example file showing a priority support API structure

These are meant as suggestions and demonstrations, not fully functional implementations.

## Next Steps

If there's interest in these commercial features:

1. Gather feedback from potential enterprise users
2. Prioritize features based on market demand
3. Create a detailed roadmap for commercial feature development
4. Develop a pricing strategy for different tiers of service

Resolves #552
