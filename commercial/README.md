# NutsDB Commercial Features

This directory contains examples and tests for potential commercial features that could be offered as part of a NutsDB enterprise offering.

## Purpose

These files are provided as examples and suggestions for how NutsDB could be commercialized while keeping the core database engine open-source. They demonstrate potential enterprise features such as:

1. Advanced backup and recovery options
2. Priority support with guaranteed response times
3. High availability and replication
4. Enhanced monitoring and telemetry
5. Extended security features

## Files

- `commercial_test.go`: Tests demonstrating a hypothetical advanced backup feature
- `commercial_example.go`: Example code showing a priority support API structure
- `pull_request_description.md`: PR description with detailed commercialization suggestions

## Feedback

These files are intended to spark discussion and gather feedback from the community. If you have ideas or suggestions for how NutsDB could be commercialized, please comment on [issue #552](https://github.com/nutsdb/nutsdb/issues/552).

## Note

The code in this directory is not functional and serves only as an example of what commercial features might look like. Actual implementation would require significant additional development.
